❤️ Cardiovascular Risk Classification using Machine Learning
This project aims to build a classification model that predicts whether a patient is at risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD) within 10 years based on demographic, behavioral, and clinical attributes. The dataset is derived from the Framingham Heart Study.
